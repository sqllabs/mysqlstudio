# MySQL Studio

## Overview

MySQL Studio is the web front end for MySQL Audit.

## Future Roadmap

We follow Django’s official release roadmap. Whenever Django publishes a new
version, this project upgrades to that release together with the matching
Python runtime (for example, Python 3.13 + Django 5.2.8 now, and Python 3.14 +
Django 6.0 as soon as it is available). Each cycle also cleans up compatibility
warnings, applies required migrations, and rebuilds the containers so the code
always runs on a fully supported stack.
